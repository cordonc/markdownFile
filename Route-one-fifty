There's no proof, actually, that my fatehr killed himself. No one knew it wasn't an accident.

There's no proof, but there are some suggestive curcumstances. The fact that my mother had asked him for a divoce two weeks before.

A fitting epitaph for my parent's marriage. But dad was always reading something. SHould we have been suspicious when he started plowing through proust the year before? Was that a sign of desperation? It's said, after all, that people reach middle age they day the realize they're never going to read Rememberace of Things Past. Dad also left a marginal notaiotn in another book. The date if five days before he died. Do people contemplating suicide get excited about spotting rufous-sided Towhees? 
Maybe he didn't notice the truck coming because he was preoccupied with the divorce. People often have accidnets when theyr'e distraught.

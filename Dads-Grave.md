## Dad's Grave

His headstone is an obelisk, a striking anachronism among the ungainly slabs in the new end of the cemetery. It's also a shape that in life he was unabashedly fixated on. He had an obelisk collection, in fact, and his prize specimen was one in knee-high jade that dropped open the door to his library. His ultimate obelisk is not carved from fleshy, translucent marble like the tombstones in the old part of the cemetary. Mom couldn't convince the monument maker to do it.

The granite is handsome, crisp... and, well, lifeless.

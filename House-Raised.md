## The house where he and my mother raised our family.

My parents had in fact gotten as far as Europe, where my father was stationed in the army. Mom flew there to marry him.

They lived in West Germany for almost a year during Dad's services, in some degree of expatriate splendor.But then, the story goes, my grandfather had a heart attack and dad had to go hom and run the family business.

This was a funeral parlor begun by my great-grandfather, Edgar T. Bechdel.

The change in plans was a cruel blow. I was born soon after they got back. For a short time, we all lived with my Grandmother and ailing Grandfather at the funeral home. Less than a year later, we moved to a rented federal-style farmhouse and my brother Christian was born. Dad started teaching high school English. Funeral directing provided only a part-time income in our thinly populated region.

Our [Gothic revival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_Revival_architecture) house had been built during the small Pennsylvania Town's one brief moment of wealth, from the [Lumber Industry](https://www.pennsylvaniaresearch.com/pennsylvania-lumber-industry.html), in 1867. But local fortunes had declined steadily from that point, and when my parents bought the place in 1962, it was a shell of its former self. The shutters and scrollwork were gone. The clapboards had been sheathed with scabrous shingles. The bare lightbulbs revealed dingy wartime wallpaper and woodwork painted pastel green. All that was left of the house's luber-era glory were the exuberant front porch supports.

But over the next eighteen years, my father would restore the house to its original condition, and then some. He would perform, as [Daedalus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daedalus) did, dazzling displays of artfulness. He would cultivate the barren yard into a lush, flowering landscape.
He would manipulate flagstones that weighed half a ton, and the thinnest quivering layers of god leaf.

It could have been a romantic story, like in [_It’s a Wonderful Life_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_a_Wonderful_Life), when Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed fix up that big old house and raise their family there.

But in the movie when Jimmy Stewart comes home one night and starts yelling at everyone…

_…it’s out of the ordinary._

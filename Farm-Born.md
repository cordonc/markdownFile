## The farm where he was born.

... there was one tale that held us in such thrall that the rest of my Grandmother's repertoire-- her stillborn twins, the time my autn had worms-- paled before it. 
> _"Tell us the story of when Dad got stuck in the mud!"_ 
> _"All right. Settle down, now."_

>_"Wunst upon a time, when your Daddy was a little boy, he wandered off. He was littler than you, John, no more than three. It was springtime. The fields was just plowed, and Bruce Lit out acrost one. It was that wet, pretty soon he couldn't lift his little legs out of the mud!"_
>
>_"But just then, along comes Mort Dehaas with the mail, and he sees Bruce a way out there, just a tiny speck. He gave him a yank, and he was that stuck, his overshoes come off!"_
>
>_"He bring your Dady into the kitchen in his stocking feet, and I undressed him right there."_

And here the story reached its bizarre, grimmsian climax.

>_"Then I wrapped him in a quilt and put him in the oven."_

She was referring, of course, to a cook-stove.
But all we could envision was the modern oven she had now, with its red-hot elements. 

The tale was endlessly compelling.

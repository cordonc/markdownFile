## Route 150

There's no proof, actually, that my father killed himself. No one knew it wasn't an accident.
His death was quite possibly his consummate artifice, his masterstroke.
There's no proof, but there are some suggestive curcumstances. 

The fact that my mother had asked him for a divoce two weeks before. The copy of Camus' [_A Happy Death_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Happy_Death) that he'd been reading and leaving around the house in what might be construed as a deliberate manner. Camus' first novel, it's about a consumptive hero who does not die a particularly happy death. My father had highlighted one line.

A fitting epitaph for my parent's marriage. But dad was always reading something. Should we have been suspicious when he started plowing through proust the year before? Was that a sign of desperation? It's said, after all, that people reach middle age they day the realize they're never going to read [_Rememberace of Things Past_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Search_of_Lost_Time). Dad also left a marginal notation in another book. The date if five days before he died. Do people contemplating suicide get excited about spotting [Rufous-sided Towhees](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Eastern_Towhee/overview#)? 

Maybe he didn't notice the truck coming because he was preoccupied with the divorce. People often have accidnets when theyr'e distraught.

But these are just quibbles. 


I don't believe it was an accident.
